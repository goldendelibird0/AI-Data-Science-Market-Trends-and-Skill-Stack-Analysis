# AI-Data-Science-Market-Trends-and-Skill-Stack-Analysis

Exploratory analysis of global AI and Data Science job listings to identify in-demand skills and common skill stack patterns for entry-level roles.

---

## Overview

This project analyzes global AI and Data Science job listings to identify high-demand technical skills and common skill combinations relevant to students and entry-level candidates.

The goal is to extract patterns from existing job market data using exploratory analysis and visualization, rather than generating future forecasts.
